# About 

NeNe's Mind is a game that allows you to escape your mind by diving into hers ... through numbers. The numbers generated resembles the many thoughts in her head that run wild. The game allows you to help her make sense of the chaos by guessing the numbers she is thinking. 

# How To Play 

When the page loads, NeNe's Mind will generate a random 4-digit number. It is YOUR job to guess that number, one digit at a time, within 10 guesses. Because NeNe really desires mental clarity, she will provide feedback to help you guess correctly. You will see hints such as, 'Too low!' or 'Too High!' to guide you, as well as a history of numbers guessed. Once you guess all 4 number correctly, you will be notified! Happy Guessing!

# The Process *
- Research
- Design wire frames using Canva based off research
- Build html bones
- Add javascript functionality 
- Get the game to work for one number using Math.Floor()
- implement random number generator using given API
- Add more input fields 
- Style using CSS based on my wire frame
- Felt something was missing from the background, so I designed a background image from scratch using Canva
- Played with the positioning of the input fields and buttons

* The code was tested many times. I love to test my code (or see what my code is doing) after 3 lines of code. I like to write bite sized pieces of code to make debugging easier. It's much easier to find mistakes in 3 lines of code rather than 300 lines. I can't even imagine why one would torture themselves in such a way.
