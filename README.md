# About 

NeNe's Mind is a game that allows you to escape your mind by diving into hers ... through numbers. The numbers generated resembles the many thoughts in her head that run wild. The game allows you to help her make sense of the chaos by guessing the numbers she is thinking. 

# How To Play 

When the page loads, NeNe's Mind will generate a random 4-digit number. It is YOUR job to guess that number, one digit at a time, within 10 guesses. Because NeNe really desires mental clarity, she will provide feedback to help you guess correctly. You will see hints such as, 'Too low!' or 'Too High!' to guide you, as well as a history of numbers guessed. Once you guess all 4 number correctly, you will be notified! Happy Guessing!

# The Process *
- Research
    I needed to know what was hot in the UI world for 2021. This project wasn't only about what I thought was cool, but I wanted my choices to be relevant to what users are using/loving nowadays. I found that 3D components, bold and blocky fonts, gradients were all the range in 2021, so i decided to use that info to design my wire frames.
- Design wire frames using Canva based off research
    I love Canva, so I use it for all of my design needs. I always like to sketch out my thoughts, so I did. I created a couple options (you can find those in the "wireframes" folder). I really got inspired by something I saw on Canva, so I decided to go with that.
- Build html bones
    Once I had a visual idea of what I wanted, it was time to build out the bones. I did that using HTML, one element at a time. As you know, at this point my webpage was pretty blah. Nothing but a few headers, and input field and a button.
- Add javascript functionality
    Here is where it started to get interesting. Without JavaScript, this webpage would be a stataic webpage and no one wants that. Everyone wants drama, dynamic sites with cool interactions, so thats what they will get. I had to get the button to work. And I built out the functionality, and move onto the more integral parts of the game ... making it function, as per the directions.
- Get the game to work for one number using Math.Floor()
    I was able to get the game working using Math.Floor() with only one number. My mindset was if I van get the game to work with one number, I should be abe to get 4 numbers. So I thought.
- Implement random number generator using given API
- Add more input fields 
- Style using CSS based on my wire frame
- Felt something was missing from the background, so I designed a background image from scratch using Canva
- Played with the positioning of the input fields and buttons

* The code was tested many times. I love to test my code (or see what my code is doing) after 3 lines of code. I like to write bite sized pieces of code to make debugging easier. It's much easier to find mistakes in 3 lines of code rather than 300 lines. I can't even imagine why one would torture themselves in such a way.
